# About

This project is part of a module exercise in distributed systems (Verteilte Systeme, vesys) at [FHNW](https://github.com/FHNW) (lecturer [Dominik Gruntz](https://github.com/dgruntz)).

A minimal banking application is implemented using various technology. This project contains the client side implementations for each technology.

Server side implementations can be found in the respective repos:
 
* [bank-server-socket](https://github.com/mikenoethiger/bank-server-socket)
* [bank-server-graphql](https://github.com/mikenoethiger/bank-server-graphql)

Most implementations rely on the [text protocol](https://github.com/mikenoethiger/bank-server-socket#protocol) defined in the socket implementation and only vary in transportation.
